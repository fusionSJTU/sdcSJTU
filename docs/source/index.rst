Welcome to SJTU Smart Data Center!
===================================

The Smart Data Center presents an innovative theoretical framework covering intelligent data fusion algorithms in detection, measurement and object levels using emerging signal processing theory, estimation theory and situation analysis approaches.

Smart Data Center provides a generic mmwave-radar-featured Dataset for researchers to use, and also provides a set of tools to process the data and evaluate the performance of the algorithms.

The multi-modality data from radar, lidar, and camera are properly processed, enabling high fidelity environment digitalization and comprehensive scene understanding. The resulting world model facilitates follow-up trajectory planning and adaptive control for real world autonomy.

.. The smart sensor fusion driven vehicles can operate autonomously with instant recognition and response to the surroundings in complicated environments at all weather conditions, in particular, using an adaptive mechanism to select the optimal data processing and fusion approaches in real time.

Please see the Fusion Center :docs:'Framework Design' for better understanding of the project components, :docs:'Sensor Configuration' for available sensors for the project, and :docs:'How to Use' for examples of Fusion Center features.
